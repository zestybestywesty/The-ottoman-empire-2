<h2>expansion and Settlement: As the Ottomans expanded from their Anatolian heartland into the Balkans, the Middle East, and North Africa, they facilitated the migration of settlers into newly conquered areas. These settlers were often drawn from Anatolia and were used to consolidate Ottoman control, boost agricultural production, and integrate diverse regions into the empire.
Turkification: In regions like the Balkans, the Ottoman state encouraged the migration of Turkish-speaking populations to establish a more cohesive Ottoman identity and reduce local resistance.</h2></section>
