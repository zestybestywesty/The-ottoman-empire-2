<section><h1>Administrative Changes</h1>
<p><h2> As the empire
 expanded and contracted, administrative and territorial changes often necessitated the movement of populations. New provinces and districts were sometimes settled with people from other parts of the empire.
Economic Opportunities: Economic activities, such as trade, agriculture, and craftwork, often spurred internal migration. People moved towards urban centers and economic hubs like Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), Izmir, and Cairo in search of better livelihoods.</h2></p></section>
