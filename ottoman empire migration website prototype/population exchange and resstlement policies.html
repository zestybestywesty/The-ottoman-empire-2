<section><h1> Population Exchange and Resettlement Policies</h1>
<p><h2>Ottoman Resettlement Policies: The Ottoman government often implemented resettlement policies to strengthen its control over newly conquered or unstable regions. This included settling nomadic groups or relocating people to boost agricultural productivity in newly acquired territories.
Population Exchanges: In the 19th and early 20th centuries, especially following conflicts like the Balkan Wars and the Greco-Turkish War, there were significant population exchanges. For example, the exchange of Greek Orthodox and Muslim populations between Greece and Turkey in the early 1920s was a major event.</h2></section>
